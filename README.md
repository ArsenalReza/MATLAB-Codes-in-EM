## Abstract
so this code is about simulating reflection and transmission of incident waves in different mediums. the simulation checks two mode of incident waves. normal and parallel mode. of course the relations about "seen impedance"
which play a crucial role in determining the reflectiona and transmission coefficients, are calculatede beforehand and just the calculation is done through matlab. we have 5 mediums. 3 of the are insulators with 
specified miu and epsilon, the other two are free space and PEC. 
in the end, chatGPT cacluated the optimum value of miu, epsilon and thickness for no reflection scenario, which was done through genetic algorithm. I think it didn't do a great job on that.
